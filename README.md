TODO
====

This is a test in ReactJS to create a TODO tracker in a browser.

You can create lists of tasks to be worked on, move them the processing
list and the done list once finished. There is a special list called
On-Hold to place some tasks you started work on and have to wait on
something to happen to continue work on it.

This was primarily a test so a lot of functionality is missing. Especially,
you can't save anything. It's still a neat little tool for daily task
tracking.
