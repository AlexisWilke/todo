TODO
====

This is a test in ReactJS to create a TODO tracker in a browser.

You can create lists of tasks to be worked on, move them the processing
list and the done list once finished. There is a special list called
On-Hold to place some tasks you started work on and have to wait on
something to happen to continue work on it.

This was primarily a test so a lot of functionality is missing. Especially,
you can't save anything. It's still a neat little tool for daily task
tracking.

INSTALLATION
============

The repository does not include all the necessary code to run. You will
have to run `npm install` to get all the files. Here are the steps:

    git clone https://github.com/AlexisWilke/todo.git todo
    cd todo
    npm install
    npm start

I suppose you will look somewhere else on how to install npm and node.
I run node version 10.11.0 and npm 6.4.1. If you have older or more recent
versions, things may not go as smoothly as expected.

I actually had many problems with my older version of npm. So please make
sure to upgrade it. It shouldn't hurt to have a
[newer version](https://docs.npmjs.com/troubleshooting/try-the-latest-stable-version-of-npm).

    # Check version
    npm --version

    # Get latest
    npm install -g npm@latest
